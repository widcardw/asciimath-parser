# Asciimath with tree sitter

A parser that transforms asciimath to LaTeX.

[WIP]

## What is asciimath

A js implementation of simple mathematical formula markup language. Easier to learn and easier to use than LaTeX.

- Without tedious backslashes of LaTeX, it is readable.
- Even if the formula has syntax errors, only a single formula is affected, but the entire page is not affected.
- Asciimath precedence is complicated, but you can just add **parentheses** when in doubt.
